  - don't use antialiasing
  - size 200x200 pixels (average lags), 800x600 - huge lags, more - wouldn't work
  - province will count as sea if province color is green + blue >= 400 && red < 96"

tutorial/content,"Hi, this is VERY early demo of game-like economy simulator called 'Prosperity Wars'

Currently there is: 
	population agents \ factories \ countries \ national banks
	basic trade \ production \ consumption 
	basic warfare 
	basic inventions
	basic reforms (population can vote for reforms)
	population demotion \ promotion to other classes 
	migration \ immigration \ assimilation
	political \ culture \ core \ resource \ population \ prosperity map mode
	movements and rebellions

You play as {PlayerFullName} You can try to growth economy or conquer the world.
 
Or, You can give control to AI and watch it
 
Try arrows or WASD for scrolling map and mouse wheel for scale
'Enter' key to close top window, space - to pause \ unpause, left alt - to add command or unit
Also we would be thankful if you will share info about this project"
